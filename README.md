# Installations
This repo will contain instructions on how to install and setup different technologies and tools that i use.

I normally use Ubuntu, so much of the installations will be for debian-based systems.

I might, in some cases, also post how to perform upgrades of these technologoes and tools. It is good to always update your software as latest versions include a lot of bug fixes and other improvements.

Most of the technologies i will share here are open source. I am an open source guy. Who does not like free stuff?
