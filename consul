Here, we will try to install Consul as a standalone 

## First, create some Consul directories that we will use later

    $sudo mkdir /etc/consul/consul.d
    
## Download and install Consul
#  download the latest version from https://www.consul.io/downloads.html

    $wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/consul/0.5.2_linux_amd64.zip
    $unzip 0.5.2_linux_amd64.zip -d /usr/local/bin/
    
## Test if its installed

    $consul

## Start Consul by running it as a server

    $consul agent -server -bootstrap-expect 1 -data-dir /tmp/consul
