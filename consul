Here, we will try to install Consul as a standalone 

1. Download and install Consul
#  download the latest version from https://www.consul.io/downloads.html

    $wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/consul/0.5.2_linux_amd64.zip
    $sudo unzip 0.5.2_linux_amd64.zip -d /usr/local/bin/
    
2. Test if its installed

    $consul

If installed correctly, it will display some Consul commands. Otherwise it might notify you that it is not installed.

3. Start Consul by running it as a server

    $consul agent -server -bootstrap-expect 1 -data-dir /tmp/consul
